<p>WARNING: These repositories are not provided nor supported by Scientific Linux. They are listed in a random order, and being listed earlier does not imply any particular merit to a given repository. Scientific Linux exercises no control (in what way) over the assertions of computability made by these sites. Many 3rd party repositories are mutually incompatible and will cause dependency issues and conflicts, as well as stability issues, if used together! If something from them breaks, you get to keep the pieces. Some of the repos, such as RPMforge, ELRepo, ATrpms and EPEL have their own mailing lists for support issues with their packages. Please read the details of each repo below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>IMPORTANT: these repos are listed here as a service to the members of the Scientific Linux Forum.</p>
<p>Use of these repos is on your own responsibility. We can not garantuee anything (since they are 3rd party repos). Use them carefully!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>Important: do not use EPEL and RPMforge together.</p>
<p>If you do you. you will break things that are very hard to solve (if not impossible) !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>RPMforge/Repoforge</p>
<p>Repoforge is a project that maintains RPM packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux. It consists of a set of repositories compatible with various RHEL versions. This project is a fusion of or supported by various other projects and numerous independent RPM packagers. They provide over 5000 packages for SL, including wine, vlc, mplayer, xmms-mp3, and other popular media tools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>ATrpms</p>
<p>ATrpms is a 3rd party rpm repository. The original focus laid upon software used in natural sciences, especially in the field of high energy physics, e.g. tools for numerical programming or such for scientific publications. But since then this repository has included many non-scientific software titles, like system tools or multimedia packages, resulting in a far more generic repository.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>RPM Fusion</p>
<p>RPM Fusion provides software that the Fedora Project or Red Hat doesn't want to ship. That software is provided as precompiled RPMs for all current Fedora versions and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5; you can use the RPM Fusion repositories with tools like yum and PackageKit.</p>
<p>Mailinglist: link</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>ELRepo</p>
<p>ELRepo is a community repository for Enterprise Linux distributions (e.g, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Scientific Linux). ELRepo currently focuses on hardware related packages to boost your experience with Enterprise Linux. For example, this includes filesystem, graphics, hardware monitoring, network, sound and webcam drivers. All our packages are built against the RHEL kernel and are compatible with other clone distributions who maintain compatibility with the RHEL kernel (e.g, CentOS, Scientific Linux). ELRepo packages are not compatible with clone distributions known to break kernel ABI compatibility (e.g, ClearOS).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) </p>
<p>Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (or EPEL) is a Fedora Special Interest Group that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL). EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions. EPEL uses much of the same infrastructure as Fedora, including buildsystem, bugzilla instance, updates manager, mirror manager and more.</p>
<p>Mailinglist: link</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>PUIAS Linux</p>
<p>PUIAS is a clones also based on the sources from RHEL and a project of the computing staff of Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study. They offer additional repos. The Addons repository contains additional packages not included in a stock Red Hat distribution. The Computational repository also includes additional packages, however, these packages are specific to scientific computing. The Unsupported repository is a place where one time packages are put, they are unsupported and may change frequently. </p>
<p>Mailinglist: link</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>Remi Repo</p>
<p>Although a small private repo, it is used by many as additional repo next to EPEL. The owner maintains various packages for the Fedora and EPEL repositories (and also some for RPMFusion).</p>
<p>If you want to use this repo you need to enable EPEL as well!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>If you know other &quot;official&quot; 3rd party repos (meaning they are not created by one enthousiastic user), post them here in this topic. They will be included in this list.</p>
<p>But NO discussions about repos! That is not allowed here. Such postings will be removed. </p>
